Welcome to the FeatureIDE tutorial.<br/>
This tutorial will help you to build your first FeatureIDE Project. After you have finish this tutorial, you will have a simple Hello World software product line.<br/>
The first step for your product line is the domain engineering. Here you have to think about, what features you provide for your product. 
For further information about software product lines engineering use the help button. This picture will show you the basic idea between domain engineering and application engineering.
<br/>Let&apos;s get started!

    <description>
       Now its time to create a feature strutured tree to implement your features.

    <subitem
          label="Open the model.m file. You will see a new Editor where you can create a feature structured tree for your software product line.">
    </subitem>
      <subitem
            label="First create two additional layers under your root featur. Right Click on the feature &quot;Hello World&quot; and click &quot;Create new Layer&quot; twice. Rename the new feature &quot;Hello&quot;, the other &quot;World&quot;."

      <subitem
            label="Right Click on the unnamed feature and select &quot;Create new Compound&quot;. You will get a Compound above with a different color. Now select the Compound Node and rename it to &quot;Feature&quot;. After that create a additional layer below. Rename the child features to &quot;Wonderfull&quot; and &quot;Beautiful&quot;.">
      </subitem>
      <subitem
            label="Connections between feature and its group of children are distinguished as And (no arc), Or- (filled ar) amd Alternative-groups (unfilled arc). The children of And-groups can be either mandatory (filled circle) or optional (unfilled circle). Click on the help button, to see how your tree might be look like."
            skip="true">
      </subitem>
      <subitem
            label="Double click on the connection of the feature &quot;Wonderful&quot; and change it to a Alternative group. Then right click on the &quot;Feature&quot; and uncheck the option mandatory.">

       title="Create new Jak-Files">
    <description>
       After you have save your project the FeatureIDE Plugin will create directories for each feature. In this directories you can create jak-Files.<br/>
Start to create a new jak-file in the directory Hello. Right-Click on the Directory and use the context-item New-&gt;Jak File. Choose the container &quot;hello&quot; and use &quot;Main&quot; for the Class name.<br/>
Open the file und write the following code:<br/>
public void print(){<br/>
	System.out.print(&quot;Hello&quot;);<br/>
}<br/>
public static void main(String[args]) {<br/>
	new Main.print();<br/>
}
    </description>
    <subitem
          label="Now create more Jak Files. Create one in the directories &quot;Beautiful&quot;, &quot;Wonderful&quot; and World. But in these cases you should activate in the Wizard the Option &quot;Refines&quot;. All the Jak File must have the Name main.">
    </subitem>
 </item>
 <item
       title="SourceCode for the jak-Files">
    <description>
       Now edit the remaining jak-Files. Every feature will refines the method print() in the hello class.<br/> Now insert the following code in your world feature: <br/> <br/>
	public void print() {<br/>
		Super().print();<br/>
		System.out.print(&quot; world!&quot;);<br/>
	}<br/><br/>
	In the other files you can insert the same code and just change the print method.<br/>
For example:<br/>
System.out.print(&quot; wonderful&quot;); in the &quot;wonderful&quot; feature.<br/>System.out.print(&quot; beautiful&quot;);<br/> in the &quot;beautiful&quot; feature.

       title="Equation File">
    <description>
       After you design your feature model, you have to create a new Equation File. You can use the New Equationfile Wizard.
    </description>
    <subitem
          label="Open the EquationFile. Here you can select the features you want to activate for your software product line. After you have select some Items, FeatureIDE will compose your features to one executable java file.">

 <item
       title="Start your application">
    <description>
       Now itÂ´s time to start your application. Choose run configuration from your toolbar. In the next window create a new Layered Application.<br/> Browse to your Project and your Main Class. Now you can click on the run button and enjoy your very nice Hello Beautiful Wonderful Word application!
