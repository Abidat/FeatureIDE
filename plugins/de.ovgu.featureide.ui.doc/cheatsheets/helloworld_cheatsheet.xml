Welcome to the FeatureIDE tutorial.<br/>
This tutorial will help you to build your first FeatureIDE Project. After you have finished this tutorial, you will have a simple Hello World software product line.<br/><br/>
The first step for your product line is domain engineering. Here you think about what features to provide for your product. 
For further information about software product lines engineering use the help button. This picture will show you the basic idea between domain engineering and application engineering.
<br/><br/>Let&apos;s get started!

Change the perspective to the <b>FeatureIDE</b>. You can use the button on the upper right corner of the Workbench.

<br/><br/>Click &quot;Click to Perform&quot; to open the &quot;FeatureIDE&quot; perspective automatically.

       Next, create a new project. You can find the <b>FeatureProject</b> Wizard under File-&gt; New. 
You can also click &quot;Start Wizard&quot; to start the wizard. 
<br/><br/>In the wizard you can select different composition engines. Select AHEAD for this tutorial.

         title="Edit the feature model">
    <description>
       Now its time to create a feature model to describe your features.
    </description>
    <subitem
          label="Open the model.m file. You will see a graphical editor where you can edit a feature model for your software product line.">
    </subitem>
      <subitem
            label="First, create two additional layers under your root feature. Right Click on the root feature and select &quot;Create new Layer&quot; twice. Rename the first new feature to &quot;Hello&quot;, and the second to &quot;World&quot;."
            skip="false">
      </subitem>
      <subitem
            label="Right Click on the unnamed feature and select &quot;Create new Compound&quot;. You will get a new non-terminal feature above with a different color. Note, in FeatureIDE, only terminal features are mapped to an implementation later. Now select the new feature and rename it to &quot;Feature&quot;. Afterward, create a additional feature below. Rename the child features to &quot;Wonderfull&quot; and &quot;Beautiful&quot;.">
      </subitem>
      <subitem
            label="Connections between feature and its group of children are distinguished as And (no arc), Or- (filled ar) amd Alternative-groups (unfilled arc). The children of And-groups can be either mandatory (filled circle) or optional (unfilled circle). Click on the help button, to see how your feature model could look like."
            skip="true">
      </subitem>
      <subitem
            label="Double click on the connection of the feature &quot;Wonderful&quot; and change it to a Alternative group. Then right click on the &quot;Feature&quot; and uncheck the option mandatory.">
      </subitem>

 <item
       title="Create new Jak-Files">
    <description>
       After you have save your feature model, FeatureIDE will create directories for each feature. In this directories you can create Jak-Files.<br/><br/>
Start to create a new Jak-file in the directory Hello: Right-Click on the Directory and use the context-item New-&gt;Jak File. Choose the container &quot;hello&quot; and use &quot;Main&quot; for the Class name.<br/><br/>
Open the file und write the following code:<br/><br/>
public void print(){<br/>
  System.out.print(&quot;Hello&quot;);<br/>
}<br/>
public static void main(String[args]) {<br/>
  new Main.print();<br/>
}
    </description>
    <subitem
          label="Now create more Jak files. Create one in each of the directories &quot;Beautiful&quot;, &quot;Wonderful&quot; and &quot;World&quot;. In these cases,  activate the option &quot;Refines&quot; in the Wizard. Furthermore, all the Jak files must have the same name.">
    </subitem>
 </item>
 <item
       title="SourceCode for the jak-Files">
    <description>
       Now edit the remaining jak-Files. Every feature will refine the method print() in the Main class.<br/><br/> Now insert the following code in your world feature: <br/> <br/>
	public void print() {<br/>
		Super().print();<br/>
		System.out.print(&quot; world!&quot;);<br/>
	}<br/><br/>
	In the other files you can insert the same code and just change the print method.<br/>
For example:<br/>
System.out.print(&quot; wonderful&quot;); in the &quot;wonderful&quot; feature.<br/>System.out.print(&quot; beautiful&quot;);<br/> in the &quot;beautiful&quot; feature.

 <item
       title="Equation File">
    <description>
       After you design your feature model, you want to generate a variant (a product of your product line). To specify a variant, you have to provide a feature selection in an &quot;equation&quot; file. <br/><br/>
Create a new equation file with the according wizard.
    </description>
    <subitem
          label="Open the equation file and select the features you want to activate for your variant. Doubleclick on the features to select or deselect. After you have selected some items, FeatureIDE will compose your features and compile the generated Java code.">
    </subitem>

 <item
       title="Start your application">
    <description>
       Now it&apos;s time to start your application. Choose &quot;run configuration&quot; from your toolbar. In the next window create a new <b>Layered Application</b>.<br/><br/> Browse to your project and your main class. Now you can click on the run button and enjoy your very nice Hello Beautiful Wonderful Word application!
