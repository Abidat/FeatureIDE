Welcome to the FeatureIDE tutorial.<br/>
This tutorial will help you to build your first FeatureIDE project. After you have finished this tutorial, you will have a simple Hello World software product line. If you have problemes at a certain step, you can get the final result using File-&gt; New-&gt; Example.<br/><br/>
The first step for your product line is domain engineering. Here you think about what features to provide for your product. For further information about software product line engineering use the help button. This picture will show you the basic idea between domain engineering and application engineering.<br/><br/>
Let&apos;s get started!

Change the perspective to the <b>FeatureIDE</b> perspective. You can use the button on the upper right corner of the workbench.<br/><br/>
Click &quot;Click to Perform&quot; to open the &quot;FeatureIDE&quot; perspective automatically.

    <description>
Next, create a new project. You can find the <b>FeatureProject</b> wizard under File-&gt; New. You can also click &quot;Start Wizard&quot; to start the wizard.<br/><br/>
In the wizard you can select different composition engines. Select AHEAD for this tutorial.<br/><br/>
On the next page, choose a project name. For example &quot;HelloWorld&quot;.

    <description>
       Now its time to create a feature model specifying the features and their valid combinations.
    </description>
    <subitem
          label="Open the model.m file. You will see a graphical editor where you can edit the feature model of your software product line.">
    </subitem>
      <subitem
            label="First, create two additional layers under your root feature. Right click on the root feature and select &quot;Create Feature (below)&quot; twice. Rename the first new feature to &quot;Hello&quot;, and the second to &quot;World&quot;. You can rename features using F2, a single click on a selected feature, or using a right click with the option at the context menu."
            skip="false">
      </subitem>
      <subitem
            label="Right click on the unnamed feature (Base) and select &quot;Create Compound (above)&quot;. You will get a new non-terminal feature above with a different color. Note that in FeatureIDE only terminal features are mapped to an implementation later (as in GUIDSL). Now select the new feature and rename it to &quot;Feature&quot;. Afterward, create an additional feature below. Rename the child features to &quot;Wonderfull&quot; and &quot;Beautiful&quot;.">
      </subitem>
      <subitem
            label="Connections between feature and its group of children are distinguished as And- (no arc), Or- (filled ar) amd Alternative-groups (unfilled arc). The children of And-groups can either be mandatory (filled circle) or optional (unfilled circle)."
            skip="true">
      </subitem>
      <subitem
            label="Double click on the connection below the root feature to change it to an And-group. Then double click on the &quot;Feature&quot; to uncheck the mandatory option. Click on the help button, to see how your feature model should look like.">
      </subitem>

 <item
       title="Create new Jak files">
    <description>
After you have saved your feature model, FeatureIDE will create directories for each feature. In these directories you can create Jak-Files.<br/><br/>
Start with creating a new Jak-file in the directory Hello: Right click on the directory and use the context-item New-&gt;Jak File. Choose the container &quot;Hello&quot; and use &quot;Main&quot; for the class name.<br/><br/>
Open the file und write the following code:<br/><br/>
public void print(){<br/>
  System.out.print(&quot;Hello&quot;);<br/>
}<br/>
public static void main(String[] args) {<br/>
  new Main().print();<br/>
}
    </description>
    <subitem
          label="Now create more Jak files. Create one in each of the directories &quot;Beautiful&quot;, &quot;Wonderful&quot; and &quot;World&quot;. In these cases,  activate the option &quot;Refines&quot; in the Wizard. Furthermore, all the Jak files must have the same name.">
    </subitem>
 </item>
 <item
       title="Source code for the Jak files">
    <description>
       Now edit the remaining jak-Files. Every feature will refine the method print() in the Main class.<br/><br/> Now insert the following code in your world feature: <br/> <br/>
	public void print() {<br/>
		Super().print();<br/>
		System.out.print(&quot; world!&quot;);<br/>
	}<br/><br/>
	In the other files you can insert the same code and just change the print method.<br/>
For example:<br/>
System.out.print(&quot; wonderful&quot;); in the &quot;wonderful&quot; feature.<br/>System.out.print(&quot; beautiful&quot;);<br/> in the &quot;beautiful&quot; feature.

 <item
       title="Equation File">
    <description>
       After you design your feature model, you want to generate a variant (a product of your product line). To specify a variant, you have to provide a feature selection in an &quot;equation&quot; file. <br/><br/>
Create a new equation file with the according wizard.
    </description>
    <subitem
          label="Open the equation file and select the features you want to activate for your variant. Doubleclick on the features to select or deselect. After you have selected some items, FeatureIDE will compose your features and compile the generated Java code.">
    </subitem>
 </item>
 <item
       title="Start your application">
    <description>
       Now it&apos;s time to start your application. Choose &quot;run configuration&quot; from your toolbar. In the next window create a new <b>Layered Application</b>.<br/><br/> Browse to your project and your main class. Now you can click on the run button and enjoy your very nice Hello Beautiful Wonderful Word application!
