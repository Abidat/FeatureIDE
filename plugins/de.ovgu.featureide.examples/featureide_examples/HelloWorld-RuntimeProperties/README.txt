To use this example you have to switch the "Composition Mechanism" from "Run Configurations" to "Properties".
For this you have to go into Project Properties (right click on the project > Properties) > FeatureIDE > Feature Project > Composition Mechanism  > OK.
After that you need to rebuilt the example project.
